## Frameworks and Libraries

we mainly use ExpressJS at LOGFLOWS, however you are free to use whatever framework that you are familiar with.


## Implementation Notes

- you can work on your own schedule, but a complete solution is expected within 14 days.
- you must be frugal in the use of third-party libraries. (donâ€™t include a 300 KB library just for one helper function)
- you can implement any additional features that you think will enhance the user experience.
